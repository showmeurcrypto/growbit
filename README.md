## 📖 The Story

GrowBit Casino is a fully functional crypto casino with slots, games, and an admin panel. Made by our "friend" **Leevi Halme** from Finland (with his girlfriend **Kauppijenny**), a Full Stack Dev & CS student @ University of Helsinki. 

He promised a lot but delivered chaos, so we're leaking this. 🕵️‍♂️

## 🎮 What's Inside

- 🎰 **Slots** - Spin to win (or lose, let's be honest)
- 🎲 **Games** - Various casino games to keep you entertained
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Panel** - Because someone needs to manage this chaos
- 💰 **Crypto Support** - Because traditional money is too mainstream
- 🎯 **Full Stack** - Frontend, backend, and everything in between

## 🚀 Quick Start
