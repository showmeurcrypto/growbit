If an amicable resolution is not reached within 30 days from the start of discussions, either party may seek legal resolution through the courts of a mutually agreed-upon neutral jurisdiction.

29.4 Governing Law and Service of Process.  
These Terms, and any disputes arising in connection with them, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws, without regard to conflict of law principles. Service of process may be effected by mail or any other method deemed legally acceptable.

30. Withdrawal Rules
Withdrawals shall be limited exclusively to prizes and shall not encompass any deposits. All DLS must be fully expended in participation prior to becoming eligible for withdrawal, whether such withdrawal is effected as a prize or converted into cryptocurrency. Withdrawals are intended solely for the benefit of the end user and shall not, under any circumstances, be directed to or executed on behalf of third parties.

To ensure compliance with applicable regulations and to safeguard security, GrowBit may require the completion of a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process for all in-game and cryptocurrency withdrawals. Failure to comply with the KYC verification requirements, as requested by GrowBit, may result in restrictions on the user’s ability to withdraw funds.

At its sole discretion, GrowBit reserves the right to process substantial withdrawal amounts in weekly or monthly installments. This measure is implemented to maintain financial stability and to mitigate potential abuse of the withdrawal system.

GrowBit retains the exclusive authority to determine whether withdrawals shall be disbursed in cryptocurrency or in DLS. As reiterated, all withdrawals shall be processed exclusively for the end user and shall not be allocated or transferred to any third party.

31. General Provisions
31.1 Relationship of Parties and No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

31.5 Waiver and Severability.
No failure or delay by GrowBit.net in enforcing any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such provision or any other right.

31.6 Entire Agreement.
